### Problem description

Encryption is the technical process by which information becomes a secret code that allows you to hide the data you send, receive or store. Basically, an algorithm is used to encode the data before the receiving party decodes the data using a decryption key.

Proper management of cryptographic keys is essential for the effective use of cryptography for security. If an adversary knows a safe combination, the strongest safe does not provide security against penetration. Similarly, poor key management can easily compromise strong algorithms.
Like a combination of a safe, your encryption keys are only as good as the security you use to protect them. There are many encryption algorithms, all with different characteristics and in our project we will focus on the AES algorithm.
AES is another symmetric encryption algorithm. It became popular for its good implementation on hardware, as well as restricted environments.
Its characteristics are:
It was previously tested to withstand attacks.
High computational and memory efficiency and low cost.
Flexibility, easy implementation and simplicity.
AES works with encryption rounds. Each round is a sequence of several processing steps, which could be a combination of substitution, transposition, and relationship creation between the input plain text and the output.
The number of applicable rounds varies with 10 rounds applied with 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.
AES encryption uses table-based data replacement with rows and columns. The substitution rule is dictated by different parts of the encryption key.
